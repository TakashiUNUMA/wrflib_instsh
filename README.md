=============

# Description

Shell scripts for installing libraries in order to compile the WRF model. 

GNU, Intel and PGI compilers are supported. 

The most simplified method for building WRF model is described in HowToUse.txt.

If you want to build NetCDF4 library, please see INSTALL_NETCDF4.txt. 

# NOTE
Shell scripts in "devel" directory are under instruction so that the use of these scripts are not recommended.
